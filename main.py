        # A better approach for production is to train the model once with a representative dataset
        # (including your 2500 scores if they are fixed and representative) and then just use
        # the loaded model for predictions.
        # For this example, we'll simulate the combined dataset for each request to show the concept.
        
        # To avoid retraining the RandomForestRegressor on every request (which is slow),
        # we will use the pre-loaded/pre-trained global model and scalers.

        # The most practical way to incorporate `user_scores_list` for *prediction context*
        # without retraining the model on every request is to use it to refine the *scaling*
        # or to select a more appropriate pre-trained model (if multiple exist).

        # *initial training phase* if it's a fixed dataset.

        # For this API, I will assume the `user_scores_list` is primarily for the *user's context*
        # and the pre-trained model (trained on TOTAL_STUDENTS simulated data) is used for prediction.
        # If your 2500 scores are static and representative, you should run the original
        # `jee_rank_predictor_script.py` once to train and save the model with those 2500 scores
        # included in the `simulate_jee_data` call during training.
